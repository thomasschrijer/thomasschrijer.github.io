	<h1>Hello and welcome to my website. I’m a human designer striving to create big, obvious &amp; useful digital experiences.</h1>

	<p>I do this at WeTransfer. I’m very glad to be involved in shaping the <a href="medium-article">brand</a> and products used by millions. For example <a href="http://www.wetransfer.com">wetransfer.com</a> or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/wetransfer/id1114922065?l=en&amp;mt=12">MacOS app</a>.</p>

	<p>Before it was acquired by WeTransfer in March 2016, I worked at design &amp; film studio <a href="http://www.presentplus.com">Present Plus</a> . I helped businesses grow with design. <a href="www.datumprikker.nl">datumprikker.nl</a> mature outside of the Netherlands and redesigned the <a href="https://www.mrporter.com/style-council">Style Council</a> section for Mr. Porter to highlight all their cool cats and their taste.
	Some other off the beat, experimental stuff we made was [A Five Dials Experiment], we helped Giles Duley with his hubble project <a href="www.legacyofwar.com">Legacy of War</a>. Combined film with an interactive layer on Future of Food.</p>

	<p>Every once in a while I send a newsletter about random things I like. Subscribe on Revue.</p>

	<p>I’ve also been involved in the following things:
	rijkswaterstaat.nl
	Top 10 Albums of 2014</p>
